|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| The minute I switched the service to include ads, the service became shoddy. It WILL NOT play ads. This happens on two different devices. Netflix stops streaming when ads begin airing with some kind of buzzing just before it shuts down the device. I'm only playing it on one device at a time. Sometimes, it does this in the middle of the show being streamed. Get it fixed, dudes! This DOES NOT happen with other apps. So don't blame it on my devices. | 2023-07-18 01:15:07     | 3502            |
| Netflix has been pretty good for me for a long time. Last update just messed up the subtitle font shadows, so they are impossible to read against bright backgrounds. The only place to fix these are from their website - not possible to configure through the app. Very annoying, since I don't use browsers to view Netflix, since they don't support all features on all browsers. | 2022-07-28 09:24:58     | 3320            |
| The content is fine but the app is horrible and somehow keeps getting worse. Bad interface, loading issues in menus, videos freezing, etc. Now for some reason, when I login it takes me to the "New and Hot" tab instead of the "Home" tab. As though Netflix doesn't know what a home tab is. I've had Netflix for over a decade but I'm about done with it. Not just because they aren't fixing the existing issues, but because they seem to be actively trying to make it worse. Meanwhile prices keep rising. | 2023-06-29 05:40:01     | 3224            |
| For me, it's finally come time to move on from Netflix. Over the years, so much content has been pulled from the app (ie. Marvel/Disney) but Netflix hasn't really had much to show for it. However, they still have been introducing price increases. I understand that there will always be new streaming subscription services (Hulu, Disney+, Prime, etc) but would appreciate it if the value of a product would be tied directly to the content that is available vs. unavailable for its users. | 2023-06-22 04:46:21     | 2971            |
| I love Netflix but as of recently, it has been glitching like no other. To the point where you just either can't watch it or get too frustrated with it. I have heard this same thing happening to family and friends. It will let you start something then instantly stop 2 seconds in and go back to the home screen. I haven't even been able to watch a full episode of anything in like a month, this is getting really ridiculous. This needs to be fixed or you will lose a lot of people! | 2023-04-03 20:06:01     | 2857            |

### Explaination:
The table above displays user **reviews** along with the **thumbs up count** (a measure of positive feedback). This dataset provides insights into the **content quality** and **user satisfaction** based on real user feedback. The **review date** shows when the feedback was submitted, helping to track changes over time.

The **thumbs up count** could be used to gauge the relative popularity or approval of the reviews. Higher thumbs up counts typically indicate that the review resonates with more users, either due to its quality or the issues it raises.


# Plot the top 10 most frequent appVersion values

### **3.4. Sentiment Analysis**

- Exclude neutral reviews (score = 3) from the dataset and copy to the new dataframe for model training.

```python
netflix_df_model = netflix_df_2024[netflix_df_2024['score'] != 3]

def label_sentiment(scores):
    if scores in [1, 2]:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1
netflix_df_model['label'] = netflix_df_model['score'].apply(label_sentiment)
```
- Create 2 different dataset for positive and negative reviews

```python
positive = netflix_df_model[netflix_df_model['label'] == 1]
negative = netflix_df_model[netflix_df_model['label'] == 0]
```
- Define the pipeline to remove the stopwords and string for wordcloud and for training the Naive BAyes model.

```python
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
punctuation_set = set(string.punctuation)

def content_cleaning(message):
    message_without_punctuation = ''.join([char for char in message if char not in punctuation_set])
    cleaned_message = [
        word for word in message_without_punctuation.split()
        if word.lower() not in stop_words
    ] 
    return cleaned_message
```

- Apply the function to clean the positive and negative dataframe

```python
positive_cleaned = positive['content'].apply(content_cleaning)
negative_cleaned = negative['content'].apply(content_cleaning)
```

__Plot the WordCloud for the most common words in the reviews__

- Plot the positive reviews text

```python
plt.imshow(WordCloud().generate(positive_cleaned_toplot))
```
    
![png](Netflix_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_files/Netflix_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_62_1.png)
    
- Plot the negative reviews text

```python
plt.imshow(WordCloud().generate(negative_cleaned_toplot))
```
    
![png](Netflix_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_files/Netflix_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_63_1.png)
    

Apply vectorizer into the text reviews prior to train the models.
```python

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(analyzer=content_cleaning, dtype=np.uint8)
netflix_countvectorizer = vectorizer.fit_transform(netflix_df_model['content'])
```


```python
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
```

    ['0' '000' '00000' ... '🫴🫴' '🫶🏻🫶🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻' '🫶🏽🫶🏽🤌🏽']



```python
print(netflix_countvectorizer.toarray())  
```

    [[0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]
     ...
     [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]]



```python
netflix_countvectorizer.shape
```




    (24195, 25167)

- Define independent and dependent variables (X,y)


```python
X = pd.DataFrame(netflix_countvectorizer.toarray())
```

```python
y = netflix_df_model['label']
```

## **4. Model Development and Evaluation** 

### **4.1. Naive bayes Model Performance**

- Split the dataframe into training and testing sets

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)
```
- Train the Naive Bayes Model

```python
NB_classifier = MultinomialNB()
NB_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- Display the confusion matrix to evaluate the effiency of the model

```python
y_predict_test = NB_classifier.predict(X_test)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predict_test)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True)
```
```python
print(classification_report(y_test, y_predict_test))
```

### **4.2. Logistic Regression Model Perfomance**


```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

cm = confusion_matrix(y_pred, y_test)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot = True)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

       macro avg       0.87      0.87      0.87      4839
    weighted avg       0.88      0.88      0.88      4839
    

### 5. Conclusion
- Netflix reviews in 2024 reveals a slight improvement in user ratings after a decline in previous years, though technical issues and content frustrations continue to drive negative sentiment. Addressing these concerns, particularly app functionality and content availability, is crucial for further enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.
  
- There is a slight improvement in the accuracy of the Logistic Regression model compared to the Naive Bayes model (0.88 vs. 0.87) for predicting whether a review is negative or positive in 2024, based on the review content text. However, both models perform similarly, with Logistic Regression offering a small edge in accuracy when analyzing textual data for sentiment classification.
